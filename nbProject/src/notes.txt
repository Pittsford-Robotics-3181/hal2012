Please *do* know that there is a Tasks window in NetBeans.  You guys can use this to flag tasks that need to be done.

Viewing Tasks:
If there is a Tasks window open, simply look in it.  If needed, right click inside and hit Refresh.
Otherwise, go to Window up to and hit Tasks.

Adding Tasks:
Within the code, add this line:

// TODO: [...]

or

/*
* TODO: [...]
*/

or

/**
* @todo [...]
*/

...replacing "[...]" with the description of the Task that needs to be done.  NetBeans will pick this up and add it to the list when you save.
