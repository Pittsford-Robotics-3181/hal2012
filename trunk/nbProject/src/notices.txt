Notice - Sat Feb 04, 2012:

Somebody who understand the Tipper class, PLEASE comment the shit out of it.  I can't understand ANY of it.

Just read the javadoc for the components used (like SpeedController and PIDController)

There is no more shit in the Tipper class, it has all been commented out.
